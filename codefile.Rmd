# Background and Introduction
This report provides exploratory analyses through 3 parts for a womens clothing firm. In first section we will discuss about feature of the basic ages, product rating and etc independently from their distributions and basic data summary. Then we will explore the assocations between the age of reviews and product departments. Also, how does the age group and enthusiasm relate the products. Finally, we will depend on the data analysis to recommend a list of 10 most popular products for the company to further consider.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we will do data analysis via 4 variables that affect the sale. They are age, product rating, recommendations, article departments amongst the respondents. Particularly, we will discuss their distributions and through various analysis among their features.

### Age 
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Age)) + geom_histogram(bins=25, col='black', fill = 'lightblue')
p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(y=Age)) + stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar', width = 0.25) + 
      geom_boxplot(fill ='lightblue')
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(Age) %>% 
  summarise(Age_Mean = mean(Age), Age_Median = median(Age), 
            Age_Max = max(Age), Age_Min = min(Age)) %>% 
  kable()
```

It can be seen from the table that the range for the customers' ages is pretty wide that from 18 to 99 years old with average around 43 years old. Since their distribution is skewed, that the review number of customers whose age is below 50 tend to be greater than the old ones.

### Product Rating
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=factor(Rating), fill=factor(Rating))) +
  geom_bar(col = 'black')
```

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Rating) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(Proportion  = n/sum(n)) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% kable()
```

It could be seen from the result that the customers tend to give larger rating. And the highest rating 5 has the largest counts and proportion compared to the lowest rating 1. Also, it is noticeable that more than half of people give a 5-rating(that is around 55 percent).



### Recommendations
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x="", fill = factor(Recommended))) +
  geom_bar() + coord_polar("y", start = 0)
```
```{r}
data %>% group_by(Recommended) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Proportion = n/sum(n)) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% kable 
```

For the recommended data, there are only two possibilities "recommended" or "not recommended". As we could see from both pie chart and summary table that the total proportion of recommended is almost 4 times as those not recommended. It is very obvious that majority of people tend to recommend the product.


### Article departments amongst the respondents
```{r} 
datamul <- data  %>% group_by(Department_Name) %>%count() %>%
  ungroup() %>% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>% arrange(n)
datamul %>% kable()
data_reorder <- datamul %>% mutate(Department_Name = fct_reorder(Department_Name, n))
ggplot(data_reorder, aes(x=Department_Name, fill=Department_Name)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(y=prop),col='black')
```
We could see that the largest amout of reviews is in Tops departments, followed by Dresses and Bottoms. The least popular department is Trend. There also a small amout of reviews that do not include department names.

```{r, results='asis', eval=(opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex'), echo=FALSE}
cat('\\pagebreak')
```
# Exploratory associations

### Distribution of age of reviewers vs. product departments
```{r}
data <- na.omit(data)
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Age, fill = Department_Name), group = Department_Name) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, col='black') + facet_wrap(~Department_Name)

p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Age, fill = Department_Name), group = Department_Name) +
  geom_density() + facet_wrap(~Department_Name)


grid.arrange(p1, p2)

```

```{r}
data %>% group_by(Department_Name) %>% summarise(Age_Mean=mean(Age), Age_Median=median(Age),
Age_Min=min(Age), Age_Max=max(Age)) %>% kable()
```

From the histogram we could see that the total amount of purchase for each department is quite different. However, when comparing their densities, they are very similar to each group. Also, we could find the similar trend from the table. Among all different departments, they all have very closed average, median, min and max ages. 


```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=Age, col=Department_Name)) + geom_density()
```

Further, in order to prove our assumption, we put all group's density in one graph. The overlap between different group better prove our conclusion. Then we could conclude that the distribution of age of reviewers do not vary across product departments.

### Enthusiastic Age Range
```{r, include = FALSE, results='hides'}
data <- read_csv("Womens_Clothing_Reviews.csv")
```

```{r}
data <- data %>% mutate(AgeRange ='')
data$AgeRange[data$Age <=25] <- "0-25"
data$AgeRange[data$Age >=26 & data$Age<=35] <- "26-35"
data$AgeRange[data$Age >=36 & data$Age<=45] <- "36-45"
data$AgeRange[data$Age >=46 & data$Age<=64] <- "46-64"
data$AgeRange[data$Age >=65] <- "65+"
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Rating, fill = AgeRange)) + geom_bar()
p2 <- ggplot(data) + geom_mosaic(aes(x=product(Rating, AgeRange),
                                    fill=AgeRange)) + xlab("Age") + ylab("Rating")
grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

We divided our dataset into five group with age range indicated in the graph.Through the stacked bar plot we could see that the largest amount of 5-rating comes from age group 46-64. However, when we see the mosaic plot, we could see that although the total amount of reviews in 0-25 group is the smallest. The relative proportion for them to give a higher rating is the highest.(It has the lowest proportion for rating-1 and highest proportion for rating 5). Thus we would conclude although there is no significant difference, that age range 0-25 tends to more enthusiastic than others.



```{r, results='asis', eval=(opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex'), echo=FALSE}
cat('\\pagebreak')
```

# 10 most popular products
In this section, we would provide the list of 10 most popular products depend on three different measurements.

### 10 popular products based on highest average ratings


```{r}
data %>% group_by(Clothing_ID) %>% 
  summarise(Avg_Rating = mean(Rating)) %>% arrange(desc(Avg_Rating)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% kable()
```

This list only listed the first 10 highest average ratings, however, there are more than 10 Clothes have rating 5 that did not display.

### 10 popular products based on highest proportion of positive recommendations
```{r}
result <- data %>% group_by(Clothing_ID) %>% 
  mutate(n = n(),Positive_Prop=sum(Recommended)/n) %>% arrange(desc(Positive_Prop))

result %>% select(Clothing_ID, Positive_Prop) %>% unique() %>% head(10) %>% kable()
```

As the table indicated, they are the 10 popular products that have highest positive proportion. However, since there are more than 10 groups have positive proportion 1, we only display the first 10 depend on their cloth ID.

### 10 popular products with highest Wilson lower confidence limits for positive recommendations
```{r}
Wilson_value <- function(p,n){
  a <- 1.96^2/(2*n)
  b <- (p*(1-p))/n
  c <- a/(2*n)
  result <- (p + a - 1.96*sqrt(b+c))/(1+2*a)
}

result_n <- result %>% mutate(Wilson_Value = Wilson_value(Positive_Prop, n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Wilson_Value))
result_n %>% select(Clothing_ID, Wilson_Value) %>% unique() %>% head(10) %>% kable()
```

We would like to compile a list for company of their 10 most popular products based on recommendations. In order to balance both number of reviews and the proportion recommended, we use the Wilson's lower confidence limit approximation for proportions. As the table indicated the top 10 products depend on the value of Wilson lower confidence limt.

Through these 3 different approaches, I would recommend the Wilson's lower confidence limit approximation measurement. Since it combine both proportion, and the number of respondents, instead of using one of these factors independently. Besides, within the results, we could actually select 10 products, not like first 2 approaches that we may have a list that contains more than 10 products.


# Conclusion

Throughout this report, we did exploratory analysis on independent variables, associations. Then we give the 10 most popular products depend on 3 measurements. In the end, we conclude that Wilson's lower condfidence limit approximation measurement gives us the better result. Notice, in this project we only discuss these features through the data analysis, but there are far more techniques such as fitting models, predictions and we could even apply machine learning techniques for further evaluations.


```{r}
x <-tibble(Avg_SD = c(0.6505803), Max_SD = c(1.564442), Min_SD = c(0.0222924))
x %>% kable()

y <- tibble(Avg_DU = c(0.0158095), Max_DU = c(0.1075734), Min_DU = c(-0.0259051))
y %>% kable()
